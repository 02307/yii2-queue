Usage basics
============


Configuration
-------------

In order to use extension you have to configure it like the following:

```php
return [
    'bootstrap' => ['queue'],
    'components' => [
        'queue' => [
            'class' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\<driver>\Queue::class,
            'as log' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\LogBehavior::class,
            // driver config
        ],
    ],
];
```

A list of drivers available and their configuration docs is available in [table of contents](README.md).


Usage in code
-------------

Each task which is sent to queue should be defined as a separate class.
For example, if you need to download and save a file the class may look like the following:

```php
class DownloadJob extends Object implements \zhuravljov\yii\queue\Job
{
    public $url;
    public $file;
    
    /**
     * @param Queue $queue which handled the job
     * @param string|null $id of a job message
     */
    public function execute($queue, $id)
    {
        file_put_contents($this->file, file_get_contents($this->url));
    }
}
```

Here's how to send a task into queue:

```php
Yii::$app->queue->push(new DownloadJob([
    'url' => 'http://example.com/image.jpg',
    'file' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
]));
```

The exact way task is executed depends on the driver used.

Pushes job into queue that run after 5 min:

```php
Yii::$app->queue->later(new DownloadJob([
    'url' => 'http://example.com/image.jpg',
    'file' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
]), 5 * 60);
```

**Important:** only some drivers support delayed running.


Job status
----------

The component has ability to track status jobs which is pushed into queue.

```php
// Push a job into queue and get massage ID.
$id = Yii::$app->queue->push(new SomeJob());

// The job is waiting for execute. 
Yii::$app->queue->isWaiting($id);

// Worker gets the job from queue, end executing it.
Yii::$app->queue->isStarted($id);

// Worker has executed the job. 
Yii::$app->queue->isFinished($id);
 ```

**Important:** AMQP driver doesn't support job statuses.


Messaging third party workers
-----------------------------

You may pass any data to queue:

```php
Yii::$app->queue->push([
    'function' => 'download',
    'url' => 'http://example.com/image.jpg',
    'file' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
]);
```

This is useful if the queue is processed using a specially developer third party worker.

If worker is implemented using something other than PHP you have to change the way data is serialized. For example,
to JSON:

```php
return [
    'components' => [
        'queue' => [
            'class' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\<driver>\Queue::class,
            'serializer' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\serializers\JsonSerializer::class,
        ],
    ],
];
```


Multiple queues
---------------

Configuration example:

```php
return [
    'bootstrap' => [
        'queue1',
        'queue2',
    ],
    'components' => [
        'queue1' => [
            'class' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\redis\Queue::class,
        ],
        'queue2' => [
            'class' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\db\Queue::class,
            'serializer' => \zhuravljov\yii\queue\serializers\JsonSerializer::class,
        ],
    ],
];
```

Usage example:

```php
// Sending task to queue to be processed via standard worker
Yii::$app->queue1->push(new DownloadJob([
    'url' => 'http://example.com/image.jpg',
    'file' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
]));

// Sending tasks to another queue to be processed by third party worker
Yii::$app->queue2->push([
    'function' => 'download',
    'url' => 'http://example.com/image.jpg',
    'file' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
]);
```


Limitations
-----------

When using queues it's important to remember that tasks are put into queue and are obtained from queue in separate
processes. Therefore avoid external dependencies when executing a task if you're not sure if they are available in
the environment where it worker does its job.

All the data to process the task should be put into properties of your job object and sent into queue along with it.

If you need to process `ActiveRecord` then send its ID instead of the object itself. When processing you have to extract
it from DB.

For example:

```php
Yii::$app->queue->push(new SomeJob([
    'userId' => Yii::$app->user->id,
    'bookId' => $book->id,
    'someUrl' => Url::to(['controller/action']),
]));
```

Task class:

```php
class SomeJob extends Object implements \zhuravljov\yii\queue\Job
{
    public $userId;
    public $bookId;
    public $someUrl;
    
    public function execute($queue, $id)
    {
        $user = User::findOne($this->userId);
        $book = Book::findOne($this->bookId);
        //...
    }
}
```
